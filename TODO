* Remove dependancy on sun.misc.BASE64Decoder

* Use the toolkit to re-impliment the CARET Tomcat authenticator (see
  http://forge.caret.cam.ac.uk/projects/raven/). Note that this
  aproach to authentication only applies to Tomcat

* Use the toolkit to impliment a servlet filter that will enforce
  Raven authentication. While this couldn't integrate with the servlet
  container as well as the Tomcat authenticator, filters are a
  standard part of the servlet spec so the result should be portable
  to other servlet containers.

* Remove duplication of split() (in WebauthRequest and in WebauthResponse)
